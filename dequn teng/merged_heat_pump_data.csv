Weve reduced our gas use to the minimum and are on a renewable electricity tariff. Im improving the houses insulation and have been looking at smart boiler controls to better manage how we heat the house, which we will be fitting along with a more efficient boiler if we arent accepted for this trial.  I have also considered fitting solar panels although have not yet taken this idea forward due to the design of our roof requiring a more complex installation.",Yes,An important part of bring the countrys CO2 emissions down is to move to low carbon domestic heating as quickly as possible so these technologies need to be the future. Im keen to play a part in moving to that future.,No,"My heating system works fine.

I see it as an alternative, hopefully an alternative that will start to become viable for all homes.",No,,Yes,One of the things that has held me back from buying a heat pump is the cost. I know they work well in new builds where radiators and underfloor heating are designed for the lower water temperatures. But I dont know how well it will work in my 1990s house with standard radiators. It would be a lot of money to spend to find that it doesnt heat the house effectively. If the system is being provided for free Im happier to take the risk.,No,"Although I make use of technology I am not normally an early adopter. I use technology where I see it can make a positive difference. For example, if Im not accepted for this trial I will probably install a smart heating system with individual room control so each room can be managed separately.",Yes,"For heat pumps to become readily acceptable in domestic settings people need to see that they work. I am very keen to be part of that process. I see it as not just making a difference to our CO2 emissions but also for every person who, in future, feels confident to buy a heat pump because of the results of this trial.",No,"I have considered a heat pump but the cost is too high when compared against the uncertainty of how it will perform in our 1990s, which was designed to be heated by a gas boiler.",Yes,"Not the entire system, but the boiler.

And a new heating system is one of the biggest parts of the retrofit.",Yes,"We are considering a range of measures to retrofit our home to be more energy efficient: external insulation, underfloor insulation, draught-proofing, better insulated windows, and a new heating system and it is frightfully expensive, so the idea that the heating system could be free would mean we would be able to achieve more of our energy efficiency retrofit plans",Yes,"As early adopters of an EV, we are excited by the prospect of being early movers for low-carbon heat and to be an example to those we know and that live close by.\nWe are already on a half-hourly electricity tariff and are keen to explore new ideas such as becoming prosumers and residential flexibility and how agile heat might change behaviour. Weï¿½ve also heard about thermal storage and are keen to explore if that could be part of our solution. In short we are fascinated by these new technologies",Yes,"With much improvement in new-build construction techniques, we also feel that retrofit is hugely important for the UK to be able to achieve a net zero carbon economy. Weï¿½d be delighted to participate in a project that researches and explores how techniques can be perfected and then rolled out at scale. And wed be keen to learn from the insights generated from this trial and your technical expertise on how these technologies work and how best to deploy them. We are keen to be advocates for successful, green technologies.",No,We are planning to change our boiler and are exploring to see if a heat pump could be part of the solution but have not come to any conclusion yet.,Yes,The boiler is at least 16 years old and is leaking a huge amount of heat where it is stored.

We have been waiting for the boiler to break but it keeps going. I have a green tariff for gas and electricity but gas is the problem I think its still only offset rather than carbon neutral. I would prefer to come off gas altogether eventually.,Yes,see above regards age of my heating system. I have been torn between investing in air or ground source solution but I think it air source is most practical. First though I am also looking how to insulate my wooden floors replace boards or I found a company locally with a robot to spray insulation only had initial contact so far...,No,No works ongoing but I recognise that works will be required to do this. We are willing to accept some disruption.,Yes,"I want to do it anyway but cost for me is a significant barrier and could only be done in incremental steps over many years otherwise. I was thinking, insulate, reduce, upgrade heating?, consider switch from radiators to under floor? then heat pump... I havnt had time to crystallize any plans as we both work full time. More of an aspiration without a project such as this. I would relish the chance to support this project and offer my property. Cost is a bonus rather than a driver.",Yes,"I have looked at it many times. In particular my work in battery research and development  has exposed me to several off grid and renewable innovation projects. My employer is investigating the electric car salary sacrifice scheme and we have an old car to replace also, if the scheme is introduced then we are considering an EV as a second car. I am sold on the idea but have so far not made the leap.",Yes,"Renewable energy is the future and I am keen to support projects to promote uptake. In particular how to make it work for old housing stock which seems to have its own challenges. I am supporting the town council in promoting the uptake of green energy at the local level and it would be great to lead by example and promote the project in the town and beyond. In a previous employment I worked in quite a few collaborative projects with innovate UK etc, I miss that now that I am in a larger organisation.",Yes,"As I discussed above planning is probably to strong a word, I am but its currently aspirational without a project like this.",Yes,Technically its working fine and we have been waiting for it to break which sadly hasnt happened. It is old (robust) and no doubt inefficient but we have resisted partly due to cost but also due to the complexity of what to change it to as we dont just want a drop in gas boiler.,Yes,I want to do it and help others to do the same by disseminating the experience and outcome of the project in the community and through contacts in the town and district councils.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been my passion to further the impact of renewable energy - and energy saving as a source of tackling climate change. - I used to put together B2B conferences and I think I arranged for Stephen Fitzpatrick to  come and speak at one or two. I currently work for Ovesco - community energy in Lewes and Community Energy South an umbrella organisation that supports communities to set up their own community owned renewables project. Currently my electricity supplier is currently Octopus energy. I definitely want to get this house off the coal fired Rayburn, which I have rarely used since I moved in, in February.  My house is south facing and ideally I would like to get some pv panels on the roof too.  There is some solar thermal on the roof so not a huge amount of room.",Yes,"I have always wanted to ""green"" my home, but previously was unable to do so as I lived in a conservation area, and now it is easier.  The house has double glazed windows and cavity wall insulation but needs insulation in the roof.  Before moving in I even went to look at Beattie passivsystems retrofit in Peterborough, but unfortunately the cost of that system for retrofitting a house is prohibitive for ordinary people.",Yes,"When I moved in I knew I had to do something about the coal fired Rayburn and I have been looking at installing either a wood heating system or an air source heat pump.  Many of my neighbours heat their homes with oil or wood as we are off the gas grid and I know that others would be interested to see how the air source heat pump works as I think I would be the first in the cup de sac to have one.  Two houses have pv on the roof, so there is clearly interest.",Yes,"The house is a project.  The electrics look ancient as is the Rayburn.  I need to, re-wire, install a kitchen, replace carpets, quite probably replace some of the ceilings, paint - basically everything.",Yes,"Air Source Heat pumps are expensive to install and given the amount of work I need to get done on this house, getting a system provided free of charge would be an amazing help!",Yes,"Ive long worked in the industry and never been able to install eco technologies myself.  Part of the reason I took on this house was to make it as eco as I could afford to do.  If I can save money on the heating, I might be able to install some pv panels - or do something about recycling water.",Yes,"I am on the outskirts of Barcombe village where Ovesco are doing a project to roadmap how to get that village off oil.  I know that there are people in this village who would be interested to replicate that project.  Part of my job is running webinars for the Community energy sector - and people often phone Ovesco to ask for advice, it would be great to be able to give my personal experience of the things people need to think about.  Also I just love innovation and looking at how we can improve things. So I would be very happy to liaise with Ovo and their partners to share data collection etc.,",Yes,"As I said above, the house is currently heated by a coal fired Rayburn which is very smokey and inefficient.  I dont like to use it as it makes me cough, so it has been pretty cold and uncomfortable here.   I was initially going to install a pellet boiler, but there are difficulties with the chimney and flue so I have been looking into an air source heat pump.  Even though the RHI offsets the price it does not do so up-front so the cost of installing one will impact on what else I can do to this house.",Yes,See above - the hot water cylinder would probably need to be moved Currently there are only 4 radiators in the house. On the side of the house farthest from the Rayburn.  None in the rooms above the Rayburn which suggests that the previous residents found the heat from the Rayburn made those upstairs rooms warm enough.  In my opinion those rooms have been pretty cold.,No,,26/04/2021,Retrofitworks,House,Mid-Terrace,Urban,1945-1964,,2.0,0.0,2.0,82.2,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.3,Cavity_Insulated,Solid,Pitched,Double,No,Electricity,Electric - Warm air,Fire - Coal,Water,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,,,4.15,52.62,11946.0,3872.0,108.0,50.0,3.82,Yes,No,Yes,No,ASHP,,,,11837.03,0.0,694.0,16.0,,Yes,,,11/05/2021,A Greener Alternative,ASHP,,Mitsubishi,PUZ-WM60VAA,6.0,R32,,Water_New,210.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Low Noise Heat Pump,No,0.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,0.0,0.0,,No,4428.6,2613.43,4652.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,,True,,BN8,Mid-Terrace,1945-1964,ASHP,Mitsubishi,PUZ-WM60VAA,6.0,R32,2021-05-21T09:14:00.000Z,2023-09-28T23:58:00.000Z,860.61,2021-05-21T09:16:00.000Z,2023-09-28T23:56:00.000Z,860.61,2022-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,2023-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,3.3,0.038,2.352,2.337,2.251,2112.86,4734.3,22.47,0.0,77.47,,-1.468,-38.43,1.62,44.96,47.59,37.12,45.85,37.87,63.35,False,0.0,cleaned,0.992,0.992,0.992,,0.992,,344.0,2.36,0.045,2.346,2.355,0.046,2.336,2.268,0.043,2.25,50.0,3.82,True,2023-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,1.98,-2.27,0.11,-4.29,17.26,17.6,16.88,28.04,55.51,0.0,0.0,0.85,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,

We have no plans to move/downsize and want to ensure that the property continues to generate a lower and lower carbon footprint.,Yes,We have a large garden with adequate space on all sides to install a heat pump and associated plant. We are also some distance from neighbours so construction and operation are not likely to disturb them. We have good access to the property for a contractor and adequate space for his working area. I have already identified a suitable location for the heat pump on a south/south west facing wall which will minimise the external pipe and power cable runs.,Yes,We are planning to refurbish the kitchen/utility room and would like to design the utility room layout without the boiler. We will install underfloor heating in those two rooms. The estimated 4% of the property that is not double glazed is the timber front door which we are planning to change to a composite unit. We have recently upgraded the consumer unit so have a spare way available for the heat pump.,Yes,"Although free, the system will still require some investment from us to maximise the potential e.g. fully utilising the solar panels with batteries ?,  installing underfloor heating (where possible). Do you dispose of the old boiler ? Would I need a back-up space heater ?",Yes,"Although rarely a first adopter, I will always take advantage of new technology when available, provided that I can see a clear benefit. The property has superfast broadband and the signal is well distributed through the house via a booster and ethernet cables (CAT6). The performance of the solar panels is currently monitored via Bluetooth.",Yes,"There are two of us in the house and can both cope with any system downtime either by separately producing hot water (solar panels) and heating the lounge (modern gas fire). I am a retired engineer and love to be involved in all aspects of technology. Heat pumps are reasonably straighforward to understand.\nThe house is as well insulated as it can be.\nPotters Close is a private road served by a sewage pumping system. I  have managed this on behalf of the residents for almost 20 years. However, it has recently been taken over by Thames Water so I am looking for a new project.",Yes,I will be evaluating heat pumps as a replacement for the boiler. We have the space for a ground pump if that is the better option.,Yes,The boiler is 18 years old and needs to be replaced. We have already changed some of the radiators and intend to continue that work. The system is becoming noisy and a Powerflush will be carried out later this year. (Last done 10 years ago).,Yes,We will install a unit to divert power from the solar panels to the immersion heater to ensure the delivery of consistently heated water.\nI believe that we live in an area where the installation of a heat pump would be of significant interest to others and could geneate further investments.,09/02/2021,Retrofitworks,House,Detached,Suburban,1991-2000,,2.0,0.0,2.0,245.12,12.0,5.0,12.0,2.35,Cavity_Insulated,Solid,Pitched,Double,Yes,Gas,Gas Boiler - Standard,,Water,170,0.0,0.0,1.0,Yes - Ground Loop,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It should make a huge difference to our carbon output.",No,,Yes,Cost has been a major factor in not taking action so far. Help in such a key area would be a huge incentive to making other energy efficient improvements too.,Yes,New low carbon heating sources must be an essential part of reducing our own emissions and contributing to overall efforts to combat climate change. I am also researching the possibilities of new domestic solar and wind technology. I am fascinated and encouraged by the advances coming through.,Yes,"In addition to the difference we can make in our own home, it is very important to demonstrate the beneficial effects to others. Many or most people are unaware of the possibilities of retro-fitting properties. Others are deterred by lack of information on which technologies they could practically use. Even the best-informed are wary of the capital cost in relation to personal economic benefit. So all research that proves the concept and makes decisions easier is extremely worthwhile.

That means carbon neutral which means an air source heat pump(not enough land for ground) under floor heating and a green energy provider. I am also very interested in the subject and would love to be a part of the project that could turn our ageing  housing stock in to a world leader.,Yes,This is vital for all of us. The west has lead the world into this climate crisis and it is our moral duty to do everything  we can to lead it out again.,Yes,Heat pumps are the only way. Storage heaters are too inefficient and so called blue hydrogen impractical as the gas system will leak loads if you put the smaller hydrogen molecule into the pipes.,Yes,The insulation  has to be top notch so we are investigating replacing our existing loft conversion in the bungalow,Yes,As stated  above I consider these measures something  that must be done. If it can be done early at less cost and be an inspiration to others that is a massive win.,Yes,I consider it my duty to decarbonise my live and home. We changed to an induction job from gas. Next big thing is going to be the gas boiler and then car.,Yes,This is the future. For us all for our nation  otherwise... the alternative is too bleak to type but it is an existential  issue. We need to stop as many tipping points being triggered as fast as possible.,Yes,Heat pump tech is the only viable  option to domestic  heat unless you happen to have handy geothermal. If this project allows  me to decarbonise my life and inspire others to do so it would be amazing,Yes,"I have an old gas boiler that needs to be replaced, if I can move away from gas early it would be amazing",No,,12/01/2021,Retrofitworks,House,Semi-Detached,Suburban,1965-1980,,2.0,2.0,2.0,104.38,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.5,Cavity_Insulated,Solid,Pitched,Double,Yes,Gas,Gas Boiler - Combi,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None - Installation not recommended,Programme_TargetMet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few year back I attended a talk on air source heat pumps and it opened my eyes to other possibilities for heating my house. Since then I have been assessing how our family can reduce our impact and save money.,Yes,Our gas boiler is 20 years old and I assume will need replacing in the next 10 years. Rather than look at another gas boiler I would love to move this to a greener alternative. I am also looking at solar panels and battery storage so moving to an green electric system would massively reduce our family environmental impact.,Yes,"My gas boiler is 20 years old and so moving to another gas boiler would feel wrong given the alternatives. A heat pump would solve two problems, replace the older boiler and remove the need for us to use gas.",No,,Yes,"I still have children living at home so disposable income is not easy to come by. To replace the existing boiler would require a large loan so if I it can be replaced while providing valuable data for other households then it would benefit me financially, the government with valuable data and the environment.",Yes,"I work in the IT industry and have always loved new technology. Where the technology is not too expensive I am keen to introduce it my house. This includes smart thermostat, smart meters. The technology behind heat pumps is fascinating, I have one friend who already has a air source heat pump. It is only cost that has prevented me from pursuing this.",Yes,I think my house would provide valuable data. It is relatively modern and I have sufficient space to accommodate a heat pump. I believe it would prove how amazing heat pumps are and that a reasonably sized house can still achieve huge savings.,Yes,I am not in a position to purchase one but if my current boiler were to break (20 years old) I think it would be the only sensible choice. I do not have the spare money to do this without borrowing the money so it would only be on a need basis.,Yes,My boiler is 20 years and burns a lot of gas.

So to do the most I can for my own home to help set an example of whats possible and what can be achieved makes huge sense to me.,Yes,"I have looked at this technology a few years ago and was very keen until consultants advised it was uneconomic in my case. I also realised that I needed to try to maximise the insulation of my home, so I invested in Norwegian double glazing (the best I could afford) and retro-fitted cavity and loft insulation. Having been attracted to heat pump technology initially, and seen what it could do in a modern home, Im still very keen to see what the latest heat pump technology can do for me and my home.",Yes,"Gas boilers will be banned in new build property by 2025, and their replacement in older properties will be similarly encouraged, so this initiative from Ovo Energy represents the ideal opportunity to do that for my home.",,Reliance on fossil fuels has to be reduced as soon as possible in all sorts of ways.

Our electricuty supply is always from suppliers guaranteeing that it is generated from 100% renewable sources. We are currently considering replacing our gas boiler and did investigate installing a heat pump as an alternative but the cost was prohibitive compared to installing a more efficient gas boiler. We would, however, welcome the opportunity to install a more environmentally efficient system if we can. At some point we intend to build our own house and would then aim to install a sustainable energy system.",Yes,"We are aware that the Government is committed to phasing out the reliance of domestic users on burning fossil fuels and the importance of this in meeting our responsibilities to reduce carbon emissions. We support this initiative but as we live in an old house, the realistic options available to us are somewhat limited. That said, we do believe that having a low carbon heating system will be increasingly important to future house buyers and we are consious that replacing our existing gas boiler with another one (albeit much more efficient) is not the way we should be going.",Yes,"As already stated, we have looked into the possibility of installing a heat pump but were not convinced that the technology available at the time would reliably satisfy the needs of this property at an affordable cost. We didnt, however, have a survey done at the time to confirm this and would be very happy to engage in a process that could demonsrate that a heat pump is a viable option for a property of this age and size.",Yes,"As already stated, our current boiler is very old and inefficient. It is also proving unreliable in terms of the control system, valves and old hot water tank. The old vertically vented asbestos flue will, we understand, mean that the next service of the boiler is likely to result in it being condemned. As a result, we are activily looking at replacing the boiler over the next few months - hence our investigations into solar, heat pumps and gas boiler options.",Yes,"We do have the option of getting a replacement boiler under the Government /Supplier ECO scheme as my daughter lives with us and is currently unemployed. However, if there was an opportunity to install a vaiable and more envirnmentally friendly alternative then we would be very happy to be involved in this trial. We understand that the current asbestos flue may be a complication but we have investigated the options for removing this and are happy to cover the cost of removing the parts that need to be removed and making the rest safe.",Yes,"We believe that the Government needs to take a more proactive role in helping people in older properties to upgrade their homes, as well as ensuring that new homes meet very high standards. The current incentives seem somewhat misguided in that we can currently get substantial help to replace a gas system like for like but cant get enough help to make installing a greener alternative a viable option. We truly believe that heat pumps, highly insulated homes and heat recovery systems are the future and the sooner we get there the better. But the majority of the housing stock in the UK is older, draughty houses with highly inefficient and environmentally damaging heating systems. I am sure that the technology is there at the moment to address these problems but the public needs to be educated about the alternatives and it needs to be demonstrated that these are within financial reach of a far larger proportion of the population. We would be delighted to be part of a trial that could demonstrate that investment in greener energy systems for an older property is both financially viable and is capable of delivering the performance needed to effectively replace conventional heating systems.",Yes,"For the reasons already stated. Unless it can be demonstrated that the new technologies are relevant for the majority of the population who live in older houses then it is hard to see how this country is going to make the changes in carbon emissions that it needs to. It is not enough for the Government and manufacturers of these technologies to demonstrate how effective they are in a new, highly specified house. That is widely accepted now but that isnt where the majority of energy wasteage occurs. If this trial is to make a difference then it needs to engage home owners like us who are highly committed to reducing our carbon footprint but restricted from doing so by the costs involved in upgrading the property we live in.",No,For the reasons stated already but we would like to.,Yes,"As already stated, we need to replace our current gas boiler and are close to committing to a replacement gas boiler under the ECO scheme.",No,,18/02/2021,Retrofitworks,House,Detached,Suburban,1965-1980,,2.0,2.0,2.0,83.71,6.0,3.0,6.0,2.4,Cavity_Insulated,Solid,Pitched,Double,Yes,Gas,Gas Boiler - Standard,,Water,150,0.0,0.0,1.0,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,Other,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Installing both air and ground source heat pumps are significantly more expensive than quotes we have had to upgrade to a condensing boiler and new hot water storage unit. Our priority is to insulate the house as we dont have enough money to also change the heating to heat pump technology.,Yes,Having seen heat pump and battery technology evolve over the last few years to the point that they are no longer niche products has pushed us towards realising that now is the time to act.,Yes,"The idea of being part of a large trial of proof of concept that low carbon heating works, is accessible to the general public and is the means of actually achieving our international commitment to carbon neutrality really is exciting.",Yes,But the expense of changing to a heat pump could prevent us from doing so.,Yes,See above.,Yes,"As well as our key worker jobs for the NHS, we are both carers for our 3 children who unfortunately have learning disabilities. One of those children also has a medical condition (Raynauds) that results in very poor peripheral circulation.

At the moment I am doing much lower paid manual work till I fully recover and I can go back into my research/policy career.  The free trial would allow me to continue with our plans for decarbonising our heating system without having to compromise due to my reduced income.

My research career on health grounds, I am very keen to continue supporting the sort of research I was previously involved in (in my current job as a delivery driver, this has involved working with a university to monitor my exposure as a driver to air pollution throughout lockdown and the slow route back to normal).  I am also aware that as an established professional working/who has worked in this field I can potentially add value to the trial.

I hope that the more low carbon technology installed, the more can be learnt about which technology is best for different scenarios and in the future I think this will help to encourage others to adopt low carbon heating",Yes,"Although we currently use electric heating it is expensive compared to gas.  I am very keen to install a heat pump to help reduce running costs through increased efficiency, but the upfront cost is unaffordable at the moment.  Plus, it is quite difficult to find installers who recommend heat pumps over gas boilers.  I am also aware that heat pumps operate better if the property has an efficient envelope but Im not sure if further improvement are required beforehand.",Yes,We are considering building an extension and I would like to coordinate this will the installation of a heat pump and potentially use the project to install underfloor heating.  Installing the new heating system at the same time as carrying out building works seems like a good opportunity and would help to lower overall costs.,Yes,"As previously stated, I aspire to install a low carbon heating system but it is difficult to justify this when considering the upfront costs involved and also the confusion as to which technology is best/most appropriate.",Yes,"There is so much technology available e.g. heat pump, solar thermal, battery, it is difficult to understand and decide which is best to install.  However, I am keen to adapt my home to not only decarbonise but also use better controls to help ensure set temperatures are delivered and minimal energy wated.",Yes,I am aware that decarbonising domestic heating is key to achieving decarbonisation targets and also one of the biggest challenges.  Therefore I hope this trial helps to better understand how best to achieve this and provide evidence to others on which technology/solution to select.,Yes,"At some point in the future, I plan to install a heat pump but not before I have confidence in the performance and quality of install.

However, I realised that although that is a greener option it is not suitable for most people . It is not convenient, it is time consuming and doe does not provide instant heat and the gas boiler would still be used.  I have decided against that and have been looking into the alternatives for my own house and my mothers.  I have researched  and sort advice on biomass boilers and heat pumps. I was concerned about ASHP initially because of some of the low performance people have experienced.  However, I believe that many of these problems are associated with poor design and installation.  I am satisfied that air to water ASHPs are an effective alternative to gas.",Yes,Ideally I would like to put a room in the loft and create a warm roof.  The property roof does require redoing as it has not been renewed since the house was built in 1904.  I would also like to put in underfloor insulation and additional internal insulation on some walls.,Yes,"The RHI for these systems is very generous, however, people do need to have  a considerable sum of money or borrow the money upfront to be able to afford  these alternatives to gas.  Anyone who receives this free system is very fortunate.",Yes,"Im not sure that I am intrigued particularly in the technology.  Is it not similar to refrigeration systems and air conditioning systems that have been employed for a long time.  I am concerned about the environmental impact of everything and nothing has zero impact or zero potential harm.  However,  we have so little time to slow the rate of climate change so we must make massive reductions of our dependence on fossil fuels.  ASHP combined with renewable energy is  one way to go",Yes,If This research informs the government to speed up their commitments to tackle climate change then I am very keen to participate.,Yes,I have done research on ASHP  for myself and my mother and have had quotations from one company who manufacture their own ASHPs in the UK.  Another Uk company has a an A*** ASHP that uses the latest and lowest GWP refrigerant R32.  This is probably the one I would like my mother to have fitted.,No,"The gas boiler is an old model probably installed in the early 2000s  However, it was only commissioned last year and has had little use.  My family and i used our woodburner and backup modern secondary burn paraffin stoves. The heating system  needs replacing as it contributes to climate change.",No,,22/08/2020,Retrofitworks,House,Detached,Suburban,Pre 1919,,,,2.0,91.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,,,,Pitched,Double,Yes,Gas,Gas Boiler - Standard,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None - Installation not recommended,Programme_TargetMet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our gas heating system is over 20 years old, so Im convinced it would make a huge improvement. Ive pestered my wife for the last few years about how Id like to change to an air source heat pump, electric car, solar panels the list goes on, but having the spare funds to actually be able to do these things has been the sticking point. The Zero Carbon Heating Trial would be a huge help and I could finally stop nagging my wife!",Yes,"We all know fossil fuels wont be available forever. With primary age children, we will potentially be in this house for the next 15+ years and would like to be running the most efficient system possible during those years. This will do the right thing for the environment and inspire the next generation (our children) to continue using low carbon technologies into the future.",Yes,"My existing heating system (gas boiler) is approximately 20 years old so is in dire need of upgrading. It is probably only about 60% efficient, whereas a heat pump could be 300-400% efficient depending on the time of year.",No,,Yes,"Were a family of four, with two school-aged children (8 and 6), so were used to budgeting and saving a little away each month. A free heat pump system would certainly be appreciated, and could free up some savings to maybe replace our 10 year old petrol car with a second-hand electric car much sooner, reducing our carbon footprint still further.",Yes,"I have probably spent far too many hours watching YouTube videos about renewable energy and heat pumps, and the speed of development in this field is impressive. With modern refrigerants being less harmful to the environment, it seems like a good time to adopt heat pump technology. I would be interested to see what the engineers would specify for our house (e.g. whether a monoblock or split system would be most appropriate).",Yes,"We need to get the whole country to decarbonise, and I think being able to share real-world experience of zero carbon solutions is going to play a critical part in the wider public acceptance and adoption instead of existing fossil fuels. Robust research into how best to deploy and use heat pumps across the wide variety of UK housing stock is going to be crucial.",Yes,"I believe our gas boiler is the original installed when the house was built in the late 1990s, so its now over 20 years old. Its got to be pretty inefficient and we really dont want to replace it with another gas boiler. Having an Air Source Heat Pump would be a massive improvement, and we could demonstrate to skeptical friends, family and neighbours that low or zero carbon heating really is possible or effective as a retrofit option, not just for new build homes.",Yes,"Like all families with children we use a lot of hot water, and this demand on heat will only increase once they become teenagers. As well as replacing our 20+ year old gas boiler, Id really like to upgrade our old 140 litre hot water cylinder for one of the amazing space saving Sunamp Uniq Heat Batteries. Since I first saw them being demonstrated on an episode of Fully Charged Ive been convinced this is a brilliant solution for greater overall heat capacity in a smaller package. Plus, we could finally get rid of the noisy water pump for our showers, as the Sunamp works with mains water pressure.

We do however want to ensure that the one we install is cost effective and efficient and isnt simply going to chew loads of grid electric when it could be a completely self sufficient system / offgrid system run from a solar array.

By moving to a heat pump we could dramatically reduce our carbon footprint, especially if we can reduce improve the fabric efficiency of the property (weve already started).",Yes,A heat pump would be a great way to upgrade the system to a more energy efficient and sustainable system. Depending on the system it could also provide good cost savings.,Yes,"We are already planning insulation and central heating changes, this would be the perfect opportunity to change the system e.g. larger radiators.",Yes,"Heat pumps are great, but dont give the best return on investment  for houses that already have a gas connection.

It is really important to both of us that we build every element as greenly as possible and given there was no central heating there and we needed to put a new system in, we are considering using renewable options. We would prefer not to use gas in the property.",Yes,"Yes, we are building a home we intend to settle our family in and we hope to install a system that will serve us and the property well for a long time.",Yes,We need to upgrade the heating system anyway so our architect advised us to look into Heat pumps. We also intend to install underfloor heating so we think this could work well with the Heat pump.,Yes,As mentioned above we are renovating a detached bungalow which was in very poor condition and had been empty for a while. We have submitted plans to the council to build up into the loft and hope to have approval within a few weeks and we are just at the point of looking for a heating solution.,Yes,Definitely! Its by far the biggest project we have ever taken on and we are quickly discovering there are lots of different costs. We hope to finish the project but we are unsure so being able to take advantage of a scheme this like would be absolutely huge for us. Particularly because there is no credit option currently for any of the heat pumps so finding that money upfront would be tricky for us.,Yes,"Yes we are amazed such a technology exists which is so green and efficient, we didnt know much about it until recently and we are still finding out about it but it seems like such a great solution for most peoples heating needs. We are also keen to explore any other new technology that can work with or alongside the Heat pump.",Yes,"Yes we would be delighted to take part in this project, we believe every house should be fitted with these!",Yes,"We currently have no heating system in our new property, was previously heated with a hot water boiler and some oil heaters. Given we have to put a new system in it makes total sense to put in a green future proof solution and we had been looking into the possibility of a Heat pump and had some very expensive quotes!",Yes,As explained new property has no heating system currently.,Yes,It is our dream to turn our new home into a passive building or as close as we can. Part of that dream is not only for it to look nice but also that is has minimal impact on the environment and a heat pump would be a major step towards achieving this.,09/03/2021,Retrofitworks,House,Detached,Suburban,1945-1964,,2.0,1.0,1.0,73.2,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.4,Cavity_No_insulation,Suspended,Pitched,Double,No,Electricity,Electric - Storage,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,,,6.49,47.83,15449.0,3821.0,136.0,35.0,4.84,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,ASHP,,,,12185.0,0.0,765.5,14.0,,Yes,,,21/06/2021,Solid Renewables,ASHP,,Mitsubishi,PUZ-WM85VAA,8.5,R32,,Water_New,300.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,Low Noise Heat Pump,No,0.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,0.0,0.0,,No,7785.0,1550.0,2850.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,,False,Quality score outside threshold,HP66,Detached,1945-1964,ASHP,Mitsubishi,PUZ-WM85VAA,8.5,R32,2021-07-09T09:44:00.000Z,2022-09-17T04:22:00.000Z,434.78,2021-07-09T09:44:00.000Z,2022-09-17T04:20:00.000Z,434.78,2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,2022-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,4.0,0.685,3.626,3.502,3.502,2821.43,9745.98,133.63,0.0,0.0,,,,,33.3,36.95,31.42,35.89,33.74,60.1,False,0.0,cleaned,0.932,0.613,0.613,,0.932,,6.0,3.624,0.003,3.625,3.501,0.001,3.501,3.501,0.001,3.501,35.0,4.84,True,2021-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,2.911,-0.91,2.2,-3.3,19.93,21.1,18.49,25.56,69.7,4.69,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,

We didnt have any plans for refurbishment, but we might make some changes if were accepted for the trial, depending on what the installation involves.",Yes,"Im not sure how anyone can honestly answer ""no"" to this question. How can the offer of a new heating system free of charge be unattractive, even if there are caveats?",Yes,"Definitely. Three points of interest here:\n1. How well can low-carbon heat pumps work to heat an ordinary 3-bed house like ours.\n2. What will the heating controls be like: Im interested in precise controls as a way people can save energy and make a big impact in reducing carbon.\n3. Most interesting: how will my home system (and maybe electric car, when I can afford one!) talk to the evolving smart grid through the Kaluza system.",Yes,For all the reasons mentioned above.,No,"Weve thought about changing to a heat pump but theyre still prohibitively expensive, so this is a great opportunity.

Almost all outdoor lighting is solar, smart controls for heating (TADO) in smart TRVs at each radiator (nine in total). This reduces my energy consumption and bills overall from the last five years. Beyond that, I use a variety of smart controls at home to manage security (e.g. Ring, WiFi Plugs) and yet make an energy-efficient home.

It is at the end of life and needs to be replaced. This trial would be an ideal opportunity to replace a fossil fuel boiler and reduce energy bill at the same time. The boiler is now small (by capacity) since the loft extension was done (in 2018) therefore a storage heat pump will be an ideal energy-efficient replacement. For now, we can only use one shower or hot water tap at one time so combi boiler is not really ideal solution as well.",No,The original property was a three-bedroom bungalow for which loft conversion was done in 2018 to add two bedrooms upstairs.

Of course it would make the property more future proof, and that would be great - but I also see it as payback. I can remember as a boy that my mother would run 5 electric radiators 24/7 as well a coal fire to heat this house in winter back in the 1970s when fuel was cheap. And that was all playing its part in todays climate problems. 40 years on I run just the 1 radiator at the minimum level I can put up with and wear sometimes 5 layers of clothing to try and keep warm. It would actually be rather nice instead to be comfortable, but helping save the planet as well.",Yes,"As already outlined, there is *no* central heating system in the property, and this is a situation that badly needs to be addressed, but in a sustainable way (please NOTE that in one of the earlier questions you asked what the system was, but there was no option to say there was none, so I was forced to tick boiler even though there is *no* boiler).\nI had not properly realised, until researching it during the lockdown period, how far heat pumps have now advanced compared to solar electricity generation, and how they can provide a total solution for space and water heating, and even cooling in summer. Now that I realise how their use has progressed around the world (e.g. Canada) I am convinced they are a good solution for my property, and something that should be encouraged nationally.",Yes,"Like many people during the Coronavirus situation, I have been using this enforced isolation to try to improve the property, but lacking any resources to pay contractors, have been limited to tasks such as decorating that I can undertake myself. But the heating of the property is a very urgent situation, as it is effectively unliveable in winter. Since the primary heating has always had to be by plug-in radiators, to heat the property to any degree of comfort would be unaffordably expensive and also environmentally damaging. But without such heating there are frequent occurrances of condensation, mould and mildew as well as the adverse effect on my comfort and wellbeing of being deprived of the use of the unheated rooms. These issues have become increasingly severe in the 9 years I have lived in the property, but on the positive side there are now renewable technologies available that were not a decade ago, and it would be ideal to go down that route if at all possible.",Yes,"Given that I am currently in receipt of Universal Credit and have no savings, it is simply impossible to install a renewable heating system any other way, placing me in effective fuel poverty and with the most expensive heating system possible (plug-in electric). Each year I have hated the arrival of cold winter months, knowing there is no sensible way to heat the house - and of course I have noticed, since moving to Rye from London 9 years ago, that the temperatures in the countryside are distinctly lower in winter than they are in cities.\nSo in short, it is both the fact that the property has no central heating (which I lack the means to install) AND the fact that a renewable system would reduce the running costs to close to zero, that makes a free heat pump system something that be quite transformative for me and an immense help .",Yes,"I think one of the most intruiging features of heat pumps - which adds to my interest in installing one, but I think its overlooked and important anyway -  is the ability to cool in summer as well as heat in winter, and to do both of these things renewably (ideally with solar PV to run the compressor). And that is not just a question of comfort - if we fail to address emissions properly, then we will need more cooling during hotter summers, which in turn could be a source of further emissions. As an example of this, a dear friend in London told me this week that during the recent heatwave her partner had brought some plug-in air coolers to her flat - she is currently replacing a boiler, so I recommended she at least consider a heat pump. I couldnt persuade her - largely because she thinks it would probably be forbidden in a leashold flat -  but that conversation focussed my attention even more on how good a solution a heat pump would be for myself, compared to say a biomass boiler. I remember the heatwave of 1976, and the heatwave last week was only a small taste of that, but also a sign of things to come in the future.",Yes,"I think this is an excellent initiative, and I am impressed that OVO is taking a lead with it. I think a project like this, especially if the favourable effects are well-publicised, can do a lot to shape public perceptions, so that we stop thinking of a gas boiler as the normal and something renewable as somehow weird. I am keen to support and take part in it, not only because it would help meet an urgent need for my own house and welfare, but also because aligns with the views I hold on responsibly using resources and protecting the environment for the future.",Yes,"Well its both yes and no! I would very much like to install a heat pump, but see no way to afford it in the forseeable future given my circumstances. I am of course looking very carefully at the Green Homes Grant scheme, but the details of this are very sketchy for now, and I doubt that the support available would cover the cost of the installation, given that there is no existing central heating system to connect to. That is to say, assuming that I would qualify for vouchers to the level of ï¿½10k, the costs of additional insulation measures needed before a heat pump could be installed (cavity insulation, possibly underfloor insulation, double glazing) would themselves be subtracted from the 10k total, leaving insufficient funds for the heat pump itself, which would be more than usually expensive because of the need to retrofit radiators and pipework. So I can foresee that whole route falling through. And of course we do not yet know whether the scheme will be able to be rolled out effectively for all interested applicants and in what timeframe. So I think it highly unlikely that the Green Homes scheme will be of help in this instance - at best it might be a route to a solar water heating installation (helpful of course, but what is desperately needed is renewable space heating as well as water).",Yes,"As already set out, there is no heating system - only plug-in radiators and a fireplace in the living room. These properties (there are 70 identical in the area) were built in a very different era, in 1969, just before the oil price shock, with the expectation that fossil fuels would always be cheap sources of heating, and were fitted with minimal insulation. Central heating was a luxury add-on when they were constructed, but was never installed in the property (it was my mothers house until she died in 2008). The lack of a heating system has become increasingly problematic since I have lived here - in the colder months I have to effectively live in my bedroom on the upper floor as this can be kept warmer by the roof insulation - but the discomfort this has created for me will have been more tolerable if it is now possible to install a system that will not be environmentally harmful.",Yes,"I have touched on this reason above, but it is worth expanding on. It is quite likely that we may face a winter of semi-lockdown with the virus situation, and already we have all probably taken a long hard look at our living conditions in the period we have been confined to our homes. Being of a somewhat  vulnerable age group (there have been many hospitalisations of males in the 55-60 age group) I have been confining myself largely to the house. That is one thing in summer, when the temperature indoors is comfortable. But I dread the prospect of months of semi-isolation in a property with no central heating, no affordable means of heating, and where I am obliged in winter to live largely in one room to keep at all warm. It would make such a difference to enjoy the amenity of a sustainably and comfortably heated house. It would make a very great difference to my life and state of mind.",25/01/2021,Retrofitworks,House,End-Terrace,Suburban,1965-1980,,1.0,0.0,2.0,70.9,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.35,Cavity_No_insulation,Suspended,Pitched,Single,No,Electricity,Electric - Warm air,,Water,130,0.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None - Installation not recommended,Programme_TargetMet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We did the same with our last house, and I hope to do the same with this Victorian house, this time going a lot further (with OVOs help). I also really love a warm house and am very conscious of the impact that has on our bills and the environment.",Yes,"The boiler is definitely the part of the house that sees the most action in our house. We have four floors which requite a lot of heating, the prospect of using a device that can heat our home from ambient temperatures from outside is really exciting.",Yes,"We bought this house in January and knew it needed a bit of work. But I dont think we were prepared for the lack of insulation, the holes in the walls, the holes in the roof (weve just had it fixed). We recently replaced the double glazing, but the house needs to be fully draft proofed. We have had some people come in to quote for the green homes grant who recommended boxing in our room in the roof with insulation and plastering, Celotex insulation in both lofts, underfloor insulation in the lounge-diner and replacing the patio doors and bathroom windows with double glazing.",Yes,"Weve already spent quite a lot of money on the house this year (new windows, ceilings, roof repairs, doing the kitchen up), so anything OVO can do to help would be really appreciated. But for me its less about the money and more about the fact that I trust OVO and I trust that they will use a respected company to install the systems. This sort of tech is quite new and not very many companies are doing it.",Yes,"Like I mentioned in my other comment. Im borderline obsessed with upgrading and adding tech to Victorian houses, our old house had a nest, a ring doorbell, smart bulbs and smart devices in every room. I love the look of a vintage property, but I also love the highest tech labour-saving gadgets available. You only need to look at our Kitchen (which weve nearly finished doing up) to see this aesthetic (I can send pics).",Yes,Im an early adopter and love sharing new tech and experiences on social media. I really think this sort of tech should be more well-known and rolled out across the nation.

My career is in the field of domestic energy efficiency so I am familiar with the scale of challenges in the domestic sector as we pursue net-zero emissions. I want to be able to walk-the-walk in terms of the impacts of my activities. I recognise that fossil fuel heating must be phased out to achieve our aims and am keen to contribute to research that facilitates this.,Yes,"I recognise that heating homes in the future must not use fossil fuels and heat pumps are part of the mix of solutions. Im aware that they operate best in well insulated homes with low temperature emitters and so my intention would be to install underfloor heating as part of this project, insulating my ground floor as part of the process.",Yes,My gas boiler is fully operational however it is over 25 years old and I would like to upgrade to a more efficient system within the next few years. Without the opportunity presented by this project I would likely wait until the current boiler breaks and would likely replace it with a condensing gas boiler which would lock in the use of fossil fuels for at least another 15 years. This presents an opportunity for me to make the transition to low carbon heat earlier than would otherwise be possible.,No,I am not planning building or refurbishment works although I would be keen to switch the distribution system to low flow temperature underfloor heating as part of this project and would insulate the floor as part of this. The project therefore presents an opportunity to upgrade the fabric efficiency of the property in a way that would not otherwise be done.,Yes,"I am of course attracted to the fact that the system will be provided free of charge however I am aware that there no guarantee of lower running costs, although with the other improvements I have mentioned to the fabric insulation I expect that this would be achieved.",Yes,"I am very familiar with heat pump technology through my work as a domestic energy efficiency researcher. I understand what a heat pump is, how it operates most effectively and what might be required in terms of behaviour change, for example to heating patterns. Im keen to adopt new technology and also to contribute to understanding how effective it can be in transitioning to low-carbon heat.",Yes,"I have worked on similar research and monitoring projects through my job at BRE.

Im also keen to do my bit to help the Government plan for a low carbon future.  As someone that works in domestic energy efficiency research I am particularly interested in this trial.

We would like to go as carbonneutral as possible, switching away from the oil heating in place when we purchased our house.  We recognise the issues of climate change and want to set a great example for our 3 year old, both in respecting our planet but also in ensuring he has a beautiful world left to grow up in.",Yes,"We would ideally like a system that moves us away from our oil tanks and oil fired boiler into greener low carbon technology.  Air or ground source hearing technology is great, both sustainable and clean. Likewise we intend to have solar installed in the future, to further lower our carbon footprint.  We want to embrace green technology and the changes that can bring and to help demonstrate to others that it is not only feasible but better than the fossil fuel dependent systems people have had to rely on historically.",Yes,"We have an oil tank and boiler and ideally I would much rather have a heat source pump in combination with an electric boiler, this would not only produce cleaner, more efficient heating, but would also help us to provide a great example to our 3 year old boy, chiming with other changes we have made to our lifestyle as a way of going greener.",No,We arent currently undertaking building works but are in the process of looking at how to upgrade our homes heating system and have a view to extending and refurbishing our home in the next 5 years.  This would be an ideal way to ensure an up to date system was in place that would either match the needs of our current property and any future refurbishment / extension and enable our old/ aging and inefficient system to be made green.,Yes,"We spent a lot moving into our current house.  We are an armed forces family, and decided to settle to provide stability for my wife and son, as well as enabling us to invest into living a greener lifestyle.  We bought our house just over a year ago and spent significant sums undertaking crucial works, such as replacing the roof.  This unfortunately ate into our budget for redoing other aspects of the property, such as the heating system and has delayed our ability to install solar power too.  That the system would be provided free of charge is fantastic, as it will enable us to make significant green improvements much sooner than we could otherwise.",Yes,"As above, we would like to adopt greener, more efficient technology, setting a great example for our son and doing our bit to help fight climate change.   We see this as an ideal way to also learn and pass on good practice and knowledge to friends as they come to updating their heating systems.  We have friends dotted throughout the country who are likely to look to upgrade their heating systems with modern technology in the next 5years or so.  This scheme would allow us to help point them to trusted sources for such upgrades too.",Yes,"This research project sounds brilliant, helping to set up a system to update older houses with up to date, modern heating solutions.  If it can produce an affordable and effective road map to enabling householders throughout the UK to update their homes in a green way, wed love to be part of that change.",Yes,"In the long run, I intend to install a heat pump, be it ground or air source, they appear to work wonderfully well alongside other green systems, such as electric boilers and solar power, so this is the perfect opportunity for us.  It provides a route to affording the changes we wish to make without taking us a long time to do so.",Yes,"We have an old heating system that is inefficient.  We have an older, single skinned oil tank, along with an aging oil boiler.  Additionally, our radiators are primarily single panel, single convector radiators with poor heat output for the property.  In short, o suspect well have to replace our heating system in the fairly near future and I fear that we may not be able to afford to make those changes in the way we would like to if that proves to be the case, as if the heating system goes in the next few years, we wont have saved sufficient to afford a green replacement, e.g. air/ground source heating with efficient radiators and an electric boiler.",No,,27/07/2020,Retrofitworks,House,,,1945-1964,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None - Installation not recommended,Participant_Suitability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are looking at all options to do so but unfortunately wont be able to afford to do all that we would like to reduce the environmental impact.,Yes,"We have investigated the possibility of replacing radiators with underfloor heating and it would be relatively simple, if costly, using a system under the floorboards in the old section and more conventionally over the beam and block floor in the 2004 section. There is plenty of potential to reconfigure the heating system and arrangement of the house. There is  for air or ground source heat pumps in the garden.",Yes,"The current boiler is approaching the end of its life, and I feel that any new system fitted should not involve the direct burning of fossil fuels. We have already replaced our gas range cooker with an electric induction range and would like to eliminate gas completely. The main stumbling block seems to be radiators, and the house is in a state where we could fit underfloor  heating if it made economic sense to do so.",Yes,"As above, we are about to embark on a full renovation of the house. As such, taking ceilings down and floors up to achieve the ideal future heating system is not a problem. We will also further increase the insulation in some areas and intend to fit more modern double glazing (current dates from around 2004 but is in poor condition).",Yes,"We could easily spend our entire renovation budget on eco measures. Fitting an air or ground source heat pump is significantly more expensive than simply replacing the existing gas boiler, and it is difficult to justify financially at the current prices. A free system would allow us to afford to make the house much more environmentally friendly and provide great benefit for the future,",Yes,"I am a professional engineer with a long-held interest in trying to combat climate change, so I am very keen to have the latest technology in my home.",Yes,"I recognise the value of such research projects, and am keen to be a part of the programme.",No,"Although I would like to, our finances sadly would not make this possible at present. A new gas boiler using existing radiators would be massively cheaper upfront. We found we could afford one part of the heating system upgrade but not UFH and a heat pump together.",Yes,"Our 2004 boiler is undoubtedly reaching the end of its life and parts are getting harder to source, so replacing it now would not involve sending a perfectly good item to scrap or be particularly wasteful.",No,,20/04/2021,Retrofitworks,House,Semi-Detached,Suburban,Pre 1919,,2.0,2.0,2.0,129.6,9.0,3.0,9.0,2.4,Cavity_No_insulation,Suspended,Pitched,Double,Yes,Gas,Gas Boiler - Combi,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,None - Installation not recommended,Programme_TargetMet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This trial not only combines having someone find the best heating system for the house but it also taps into the other grants that would make the house more insulated. We already have cavity wall insulation they injected it in the walls years ago, we didnt find this made much difference. Our loft is very insulated apart from the loft hatch, but we are really keen to make any recommended improvements to help us and the environment.",Yes,"As per above our heating system is 20 years + and the new system should be a air or ground pump. Ive been looking into these systems for years, but again it is the upfront cost and also picking the best supplier.",No,,Yes,"I dont have a lump sum to buy a air or ground source air pump even though ive looked into the RHI repayments over 7 years. But apart from the money it was the fact that this is a complete package. So your team will come up with the best heating solution for the house and you have access to the ï¿½5000 of improvements grants as well if needed. And the fact that you are monitoring the performance of the system. Im not sure there wont be any cost savings for us based on our gas bills, but it will future proof the house, and hopefully our bills overall wont increase.",Yes,I have been looking at ground and air source heat pumps for a number of years. I know that a air source produces 3x energy and ground 4x energy but at a lower temperature so bigger radiators are required. Im not sure if the garden is big enough to take a ground source pump but ill leave that to the assessors.,Yes,"I think we need to have more information about heat pumps, ive read lots of reviews but to have a central source of information would be good. Im guessing that i wont be saving on my energy bills from gas to heat pump but it would be good for other people to be able to access that information from these trials.",No,I wouldnt have enough money to change to a heat pump so this trial gives me that opportunity.,No,"My heating system is 20 years + old. It is working but it had a little glitch 2 days ago, didnt work for a day and then started working again. We already know that it is very difficult to get parts for it now. When it had a glitch a couple of years ago, we were lucky to find parts on e-bay.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is very confusing to sift through all the options that are available and understand what the best solution might be.,Yes,"Our current boiler is very old and we are looking at the option of replacing with an air pump heat system but as our house was built in the late 1960s/early 1970s we are not sure whether the financials stack up. Having done some research we believe in order for the air source heat pump to be effective we would have to invest a huge amount in cavity wall insulation, replace our very old double glazing, replace the radiators with larger units (or install underfloor heating) and ideally fit some solar panels to reduce reliance on electricity supply. As electricity is much more expensive than gas it may end up being more expensive to run an air source heat pump. Also we believe we may need a secondary heater for hot water. We are a family of four with two very sporty children, lots of showers and lots of washing machine cycles and tumble drying. Despite the current government grants it looks like it may be too expensive for us despite our enthusiasm to move to a more sustainable heat source.",Yes,We are intending to rewire the house as it is a very old system and add an ensuite bathrooom as well as generally redecorate.,Yes,As mentioned previously we believe that the current grants etc and costs of the system and ongoing electricity price will mean that if we installed an air source heat pump over time we would be financially worse off than replacing with a more modern gas boiler.,Yes,As we intend to stay in the house for the long term we would like to adopt new technology to make it more efficient but struggle to sift through all the various systems and options.,Yes,We would like to be involved as we would like to believe that more environmentally friendly options are viable for retrofit.,Yes,As above we have looked at replacing our gas boiler with a heat pump but believe in the long term would still be more expensive.,Yes,"As mentioned above, we need to replace our ageing boiler but are currently looking at the options and were disappointed to learn that a pump system could be more expensive.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weve always been intrigued and impressed by the system and how well it functions in cold temperatures.

Renewable energy is so important and it feels like the UK is very much behind in this field particularly compared to Scandinavia.  We would be happy to do whatever we can to test and promote the technology,Yes,This would give us an opportunity to go ahead with our dream to get a heat pump that would be out of our reach financially right now without some support from a scheme like this.,No,We dont currently have central heating so not quite a replacement as such,Yes,"Only to add that its really, really cold right now without central heating and we would hugely appreciate being considered for this trial so we can make a warm and comfortable home for our son.
